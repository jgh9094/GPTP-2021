# Increasing population size vs increasing generations

Here, we test whether increasing population size or increasing generations is most valuable for performance on the exploration diagnostic.

This experiment is identical to 2021-06-02-cardinality-pop-size, except we run for longer (x10 total evaluations) to get a better picture of longer-term dynamics.
