# Increasing population size vs increasing generations

Here, we test whether increasing population size or increasing generations is most valuable for performance on the exploration diagnostic.

Takeaways

- Larger population size does maintain more starting positions simultaneously in the population
- Increasing generations (as opposed to increasing population size) improves rate of exploitation
- Want to run for quite a bit longer to see if increasing pop size eventually overtakes, or if it is always better to just run for more generations
