# Novelty lexicase - increased population sizes and decreased objective counts

This experiment checks to see if novelty test cases help with increased pop sizes (i.e., better specialist maintenance) or reduced objective counts (i.e., fewer specialists required).

Parameters (at a range of K values)

- 50 objectives, 500 population size
- 50 objectives, 1000 population size
- 100 objectives, 1000 population size
